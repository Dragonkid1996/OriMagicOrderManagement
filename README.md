# OriMagic Order Management
---
## Project Overview 
---
### Application Description:
The application will provide an interface for an origami shop owner to sell their products. They will be able to create new models with high levels of detail, including model complexity and number of units, colours needed, etc. They will also be able to remove models which are no longer sold, and modify models to make changes as well. A buyer interface for the application will also be created to allow buyers to peruse the models being sold and add them to a basket. When an order is placed, it will show in the shop owner view.
