# OriMagic Order Management
---
## Project Overview 
---
### Application Description:
The application will provide an interface for an origami shop owner to sell their products. They will be able to create new models with high levels of detail, including model complexity and number of units, colours needed, etc. They will also be able to remove models which are no longer sold, and modify models to make changes as well. A buyer interface for the application will also be created to allow buyers to peruse the models being sold and add them to a basket. When an order is placed, it will show in the shop owner view.

### Sprint 1 - Tuesday 1st December 2020

By the end of this sprint I aimed to have the basis of a three-tier application, setting out the different projects within the solution. I also wanted to build the database, design the CRUD manager, and create a Graphical User Interface.

#### Sprint Goals

* Set out the basics of the application
- [x] Complete User Story 0.1
- [x] Complete User Story 0.2
- [x] Complete User Story 0.4
- [x] Update README
- [x] Commit all changes to Github repository

#### Sprint Review

The database was completed, the GUI was design and the CRUD manager now has the core functionality it needs to build the application on top. I began adding some data to the database as well.

#### Sprint Retrospective

The sprint went rather smoothly, the only blocker was my computer's limitations. However, after waiting a few minutes for it to respond, I was able to get back to work.
